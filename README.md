# About
This is my final project for IBM data science professional certficate. In this project I work as a data scientist and then
make a classification model that predicts whether future SpaceX falcon9 rocket launches' first stage will land successfully
or not. All the notebooks are uploaded here that cover the entire process from start to end. Also a python code for creating an 
interactive dashboard is also added along with a csv file.
